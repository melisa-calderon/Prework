## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ X ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ X ] Tip Slider Option

## Notes

It was changing dealing with constraints, but after a while I learned how they work better. It was also a bit challenging getting the slider to work how I wanted to, but I got it to work like I wanted to.
